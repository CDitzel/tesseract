// The proxy pattern uses a class buffer to allow the system to perceive the
// target as an object independent of its underlying composition (dependency
// injection) rather than
// making the target inherit from the observer class. The proxy pattern buffers
// communication between publishers and observers.
// First, it increases clarity in the target classâ€™s public interface by
// replacing a generically named notify() function with a descriptively named
// event
// handling function. Second, an otherwise unnecessary inheritance from the
// Observer class is removed. Eliminating this dependency reduces coupling,
// increases cohesion, and facilitates reuse of the target in a setting where it
// is
// not an observer. Third,
// using a proxy class eliminates the ambiguity that arises for a target class
// that
// needs to listen to multiple events. Without using proxy classes, an observer
// would be required to disambiguate events in its single notify() function.
// Using
// an individual proxy for each event enables each event to call a unique
// handler
// function in the target object. The main disadvantage of implementing the
// observer pattern using a proxy is the slight cost of one extra indirection
// for
// handling each event. However, in situations where using the observer pattern
// is
// appropriate, the cost of an extra indirection is negligible.
